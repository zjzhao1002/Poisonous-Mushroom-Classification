# Poisonous-Mushroom-Classification
The goal of these notebooks are to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its physical characteristics. Two models have been used: Deep Neural Network and XGBoost.

These notebooks are submitted to the competition [Binary Prediction of Poisonous Mushrooms](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e8) of Kaggle.
